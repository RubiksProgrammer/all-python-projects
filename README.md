# All Python Projects

This repository holds all my old Python projects from when I started learning Python in grade 10. It includes:
- a simple console based tic tac toe game
- a mental math practicing game (you can time your mental math skills with different addition and multiplication problems)
- a program to find the way to win marble solitaire (didn't actually work since it just kept running, but it was still a fun project)
- a program to autonomously open up the online typing game "TypeRacer" and type at a speed of approximately 130 wpm
- and more!
